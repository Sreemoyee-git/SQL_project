Problem Statement

The aim of this project was to analyze Online Shopping Sales data using SQL to uncover meaningful business insights. The main goal was to identify customer behavior, sales trends, product performance, and revenue generation patterns. The project focused on understanding how different factors like customer location, product category, payment methods, and seller performance contribute to overall sales, with the objective of improving profitability and customer retention.

What I Did

1. Data Exploration:

Listed all unique customer cities and states to understand the company’s geographical spread.

Counted the total number of orders placed within specific years to track sales growth over time.

2. Sales and Revenue Analysis:

Calculated total sales per product category by combining price and freight values.

Determined the percentage contribution of each category to total sales.

Identified top-performing sellers by calculating total revenue generated and ranking them.

Measured average price and number of purchases per product to find the best-selling items.

3. Customer Insights:

Counted customers by city and state to determine regional engagement.

Calculated average number of products per order for each city.

Found repeat customers (those who placed multiple orders) to assess loyalty.

4. Time-Based Analysis:

Computed number of orders per month and year-over-year sales growth using window functions.

Calculated cumulative and moving averages to observe seasonal patterns and demand shifts.

5. Retention and Ranking:

Computed retention rates using first and last purchase timestamps.

Identified top 3 customers each year based on total spending.


Tools Used

Python: For data cleaning, and modification

SQL (MySQL): For data extraction, aggregation, and analysis.

Database Management System: To run and store queries efficiently.

Recommendations

1. Customer Retention Programs: Since retention is 0%, the company should pay more attentions to this segment, the company should introduce loyalty rewards and personalized offers.

2. Category Optimization: Focus on top-selling product categories and consider improving underperforming ones with targeted marketing.

3. Seasonal Strategy: Utilize month-wise order trends to plan stock, pricing, and promotions during high-demand periods.

4. Seller Performance Management: Regularly monitor top and low-performing sellers to maintain consistent service and quality.

5. Payment Analytics: Expand analysis to payment methods to understand customer preferences for installment or one-time payments.

Conclusion

This SQL-based analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of sales, customer distribution, and product performance in an E-commerce setup. By leveraging data-driven insights, the company can make more informed business decisions—such as improving supply chain efficiency, targeting key markets, and enhancing customer satisfaction. The project strengthened my SQL proficiency, particularly in joins, aggregations, window functions, and ranking queries, while demonstrating how analytical SQL can drive meaningful business strategy.
